This is my GitHub Pages site for MTM6201.

How I created my Web Portfolio:
I used a mixture of bootstrap and custom css to achieve the mockup of my web portfolio.

Challenges Faced:
The biggest challenge was making sure the about page and contact page were large enough to fit the full screen so there was no white bar underneath the web page. I overcame this challenge by adding more margin to the top and bottom of the content to strech out the pages. The second largest challenge was having the footer nav appear in a certain position on one screen size and disapear while keeping the social media icons on a different size. I overcame this challenge by using multiple media queries on my custom styles css sheet.

What I learned:
I learned how to use a custom css sheet to customize bootstrap to match my mockup. I also gained a deeper insight into what bootstrap has to offer, more specifically how to combine components to create unique looking layouts. For example: Making the navbar transparent and overlaying it on my hero image inside a jumbotron.
